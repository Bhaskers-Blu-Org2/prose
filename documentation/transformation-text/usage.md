{% include toc.liquid.md %}

The `Transformation.Text` API is accessed through the `Transformation.Text.Session` class. The primary methods are
`Constraints.Add()` which adds examples (or other constraints) to a session and `Learn()` which and learns a
`Transformation.Text` program consistent with those examples. In order to use `Transformation.Text`, you need assembly
references to `Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis.Transformation.Text.dll`,
`Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis.Transformation.Text.Language.dll`, and
`Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis.Transformation.Text.Semantics.dll`.


## Basic usage

```csharp
Session session = new Session();
IEnumerable<Example> examples = new[]
{
    new Example(new InputRow("Greta Hermansson"), "Hermansson, G.")
};
session.Constraints.Add(examples);
Program program = session.Learn();
object output = program.Run(new InputRow("Kettil Hansson")); // output is "Hansson, K."
```

The examples are given as an `IEnumerable<Example>` with the input and the correct output. The input to
`Transformation.Text` is a row of a table of data which may include data from multiple columns. The `InputRow` type lets
you give a row as just a list of `string`s without naming the columns. To get more control, implement
`Transformation.Text`&apos;s `IRow` interface.


### One example with multiple strings

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("Greta", "Hermansson"), "Hermansson, G."))
Program program = session.Learn();
string output = program.Run(new InputRow("Kettil", "Hansson")) as string; // output is "Hansson, K.
```

(While the API types the output of running a `Transformation.Text` program as `object`, the output type will always be
`string` (or `null`) in the current version. The cast to `string` is done using `as string` to acknowledge that future
versions of `Transformation.Text` may support other return types.)

### Multiple examples

`Transformation.Text` can be given multiple examples in order to generate a program that will generalize over
differently formatted inputs. In this example, we give `Transformation.Text` a phone number to normalized in two
different formats and it is able to take a phone number in a third similar format and normalize it as well.

```csharp
var session = new Session();
var examples = new[]
{
    new Example(new InputRow("212-555-0183"), "212-555-0183"),
    new Example(new InputRow("(212) 555 0183"), "212-555-0183")
};
session.Constraints.Add(examples);
Program program = session.Learn();
string output = program.Run(new InputRow("425 311 1234")) as string; // output is "425-311-1234"
```

If your input data is in multiple formats, you will likely have to provide more than one example. A common workflow is
to have the user give a small number of examples and then inspect the output (possibly with inputs to inspect suggested
by the significant inputs feature) and have the option of providing additional examples if they discover an undesired
result. The code for that workflow might look something like this:

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("212-555-0183"), "212-555-0183"));
Program program = session.Learn();
// ... check program and find it is does not work as desired.
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("(212) 555 0183"), "212-555-0183"));
program = session.Learn();
string output = program.Run(new InputRow("425 311 1234")) as string; // output is "425-311-1234"
```


## Inputs without known outputs

Most likely, when learning a program, you will have some idea of other inputs you intend to run the program on in the
future. `Transformation.Text` can take those inputs and use them to help decide which program to return.

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Inputs.Add(new InputRow("04/02/1962"),
                  new InputRow("27/08/1998"));
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("02/04/1953"), "1953-04-02"));
Program program = session.Learn();
string output = program.Run("31/01/1983") as string; // output is "1983-01-31"
```


## Learning multiple programs

There are usually a large number of programs consistent with any given set of examples. `Transformation.Text` has a
ranking scheme which it uses to return the most likely program for the examples it has seen, but in some cases this may
not be the desired program.

`LearnTopK()` has a parameter `k` which specifies how many programs it should try to learn; it returns the top `k`
ranked programs (or programs with the top `k` ranks if there are ties).

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("Greta Hermansson"), "Hermansson"));
// Learn top 10 programs instead of just the single top program.
IReadOnlyList<Program> programs = session.LearnTopK(k: 10);
foreach (Program program in programs)
{
    Console.WriteLine(program.Run(new InputRow("Kettil Hansson Smith"))); // note that this input has a middle name
}
```

The first several programs output "Smith", but after that one outputs "Hansson Smith". This could be used to ask the
user which they meant or to do automated reranking of the top results based on some logic other than
`Transformation.Text`&apos;s internal ranking system.

To specifically get the top distinct outputs, without needing to directly access the programs, use
`ComputeTopKOutputsAsync()`:

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("Greta Hermansson"), "Hermansson"));
IReadOnlyList<object> outputs = await session.ComputeTopKOutputsAsync(new InputRow("Kettil Hansson Smith"), k: 10);
foreach (object output in outputs)
{
    Console.WriteLine(output);
}
```

## Serializing programs

Sometimes you will want to learn a program in one session and run it on other data in a future session or transfer
learned programs between computers. In order to do so, PROSE supports serializing programs:

```csharp
var session = new Session();
session.Constraints.Add(new Example(new InputRow("Kettil Hansson"), "Hansson, K."));
Program program = session.Learn();
// Programs can be serialized using .Serialize().
string serializedProgram = program.Serialize();
// Serialized programs can be loaded in another program using the Transformation.Text API using .Load():
Program parsedProgram = Loader.Instance.Load(serializedProgram);
// The program can then be run on new inputs:
Console.WriteLine(parsedProgram.Run(new InputRow("Etelka Bala"))); // outputs "Bala, E."
```

## API


### Learning `Transformation.Text` programs

To start, construct an empty `Session` which encapsulates learning a program for a single task, often refined over the
course of multiple learning calls.

The collection of all known inputs should be provided using `.Inputs.Add()`. `Transformation.Text` can make good use of
around one hundred inputs; providing over a thousand may cause performance issues for some operations, although it will
attempt to work on only a randomly selected sample when possible if too many inputs are provided. If selecting a subset
of inputs to provide, they should be representative of the inputs the program will be run on. The inputs provided can be
accessed using `.Inputs` and removed using `.RemoveInputs()` or `RemoveAllInputs()`.

The main input to the learning procedure is a set of **constraints**, primarily examples, which are provided using
`.Constraints.Add()`. The following are common constraints used with `Transformation.Text`:

* **`Example`** (or `Example<IRow, object>`). The most common constraint. Asserts what the output should be for a
  specific input.

* **`DoesNotEqual<IRow, object>`**. The opposite: for a specific input, gives a specific disallowed output.

* **`ColumnPriority`**. Used to specify which columns of the input to use. Useful if the `IRow` implementation exposes
  many columns but only a few columns should be used by the program.

* **`OutputIs<IRow, object>`**. Constrains the output to be of a specific semantic kind. Note that the .NET type of the
  output will still be `string`; support for other .NET types in the output is expected in the future. The supported
  types for this constraint are `NumberType`, `PartialDateTimeType`, and `FormattedPartialDateTimeType.

* See the `Transformation.Text.Constraints` namespace for other constraints.

`Session` has three different methods for learning (plus "`Async`" variants):

* `Learn()`/`LearnAsync()` returns the single top-ranked program as a `Program`.
* `LearnTopK()`/`LearnTopKAsync()` takes an integer `k` and returns the top-`k` ranked programs as an
  `IReadOnlyList<Program>`.
* `LearnAll()`]/`LearnAllAsync()` learns all programs consistent with the examples, giving the result compactly as a
  `ProgramSet` (wrapped in an `IProgramSetWrapper`).

To run a `Program`, use its `Run()` method:

```csharp
public object Run(IRow input)
```

If performance of running a single program on many inputs is an issue, then implementing the `IIndexableRow` interface
and using the `Run(IIndexableRow)` variant may help.
