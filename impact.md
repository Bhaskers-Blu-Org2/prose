## SQL Server Management Studio - Import Flat File

Our predictive program synthesis technology has been released in SQL Server Management Studio,
behind the new feature *Import Flat File Wizard*, which helps streamline the import experience for a user who wants to import `.csv` or `.txt` files without specialized domain knowledge.
This feature builds on top of the PROSE SDK, and leverages ideas from the following [research papers]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources):
